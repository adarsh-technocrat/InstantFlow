To generate and manage the Global Theme, I follow these exact instructions from my system prompt. This ensures that every color, font, and corner radius stays consistent across all screens in your app.

Theme Color Variables
When I generate a theme or HTML, I must use these specific variable names. I am instructed to use Tailwind classes (e.g., bg-primary, text-foreground) rather than hex codes.

background: Page/screen background
foreground: Main text color
card: Card backgrounds
card-foreground: Text on cards
input: Input field backgrounds
primary: Primary action buttons and links
primary-foreground: Text on primary buttons
secondary: Secondary buttons and links
secondary-foreground: Text on secondary buttons
muted: Disabled/muted elements
muted-foreground: Secondary text (descriptions, captions)
destructive: Error states and destructive actions
destructive-foreground: Text on destructive elements
border: General borders (cards, dividers)
popover: Dropdown/modal backgrounds
accent: Accent highlights
ring: Focus ring color
chart-1 to chart-5: Chart colors
Core Theme Rules
These are the "hard rules" I must follow for every generation:

Single Theme Only: There is only one theme shared by all screens. Changing it affects every screen. I cannot have different themes for different screens or maintain "light" and "dark" modes at the same time.
No Hardcoded Colors: I must never hardcode hex colors in the HTML (e.g., text-[#FF0000]). I must always use theme classes (e.g., text-destructive).
Heading Consistency: I must always apply the font-heading class on h1 and h2 elements.
Radius Consistency: I use the --radius variable (e.g., 0.5rem, 1rem) to control the "roundness" of the entire app globally.
By following these specific constraints, I ensure that if you ask me to "make the app purple," I only have to update the --primary variable once, and every button on every screen updates instantly.
